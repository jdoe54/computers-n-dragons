# computers-n-dragons

Originally created during an iD Tech Summer Camp in June 2016. It is a text adventure game created in C++ inspired by 
Dwarf Fortress and Dungeons and Dragon.

The project has been not maintained since 2016, but I will add some changes to a new repo called computers-n-dragons-2023 repo.
